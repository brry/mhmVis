### mhmVis
An R package to visualise mHM input and output files, including creating an animated movie from netcdf files.
This is work-in-heavy-progress and subject to many improvements...

This is planned to be linked with [mHMr](https://github.com/JBrenn/mHMr) one day.

### installation

Install dependencies:
```R
install.packages("berryFunctions")
install.packages("OSMscale")
library(OSMscale)
```
There are [instructions](https://github.com/brry/OSMscale#intro) 
in case `OSMscale` does not install out of the box.

Update dependencies and install `mhmVis` itself:
```R
berryFunctions::instGit("brry/berryFunctions")
berryFunctions::instGit("brry/OSMscale")
berryFunctions::instGit("brry/mhmVis")
```
