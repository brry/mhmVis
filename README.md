### mhmVis
An R package to visualise mHM input and output files, including netcdf files.
This is work-in-heavy-progress and subject to many improvements...

### installation

Install dependencies:
```R
install.packages("berryFunctions")
install.packages("OSMscale")
library(OSMscale)
```
If `OSMscale` does not work out of the box, you may need to follow the instructions at 
<https://github.com/brry/OSMscale#intro>

Update dependencies and install `mhmVis` itself:
```R
berryFunctions::instGit("brry/berryFunctions")
berryFunctions::instGit("brry/OSMscale")
berryFunctions::instGit("brry/mhmVis")
```
